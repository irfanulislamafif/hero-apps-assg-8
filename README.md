# GemStore - Hidden Gems App Discovery

## 📌 Project Overview
**GemStore** is a curated App Store application designed to help users discover unique, high-utility, and "hidden gem" mobile applications that often fly under the radar. Unlike standard app stores that focus on trending games, GemStore focuses on creativity, human connection, and genuine utility.

This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in **React.js**, **Routing**, **Data Visualization**, and **State Management** (including LocalStorage).

## 🚀 Technologies Used
* **Frontend Library:** React.js
* **Routing:** React Router DOM (v6)
* **Charts:** Recharts (for data visualization)
* **Notifications:** React Toastify
* **Styling:** CSS3 / Tailwind CSS (Responsive Design)
* **Data Handling:** JSON & LocalStorage
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
